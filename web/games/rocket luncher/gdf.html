        <h1>Life and Learning3</h1>
        <p>If you're young and exploring new things like using a PC, preparing for a future job, or like me, learning coding, you know how hard and stressful it can be.</p>
        <p>And because it's easier said than done, you might find yourself just asking your parents to "buy this, that."</p>
        <p>But if you spend all your time relaxing, playing video games, and doing nothing productive, it can have consequences.</p>
        <p>When you reach the age where you need a job, you might realize you lack the necessary experience. You can play games, but you don't know how to create files, use other editor apps, or develop important skills.</p>
